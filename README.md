## Global EV Charging Stations
The EV Charging Stations Data App is a simple web tool that gives real information about where to find charging stations for electric cars around the world. It uses clear charts, maps, and data tables to help users find stations, understand trends, and plan trips with ease. With more people driving electric cars, finding a place to charge is very important. The app shows a dashboard with easy to read graphs and a map that groups nearby charging stations together. It also has a page that introduces the team behind the project and lists the sources of its data, making everything clear and trustworthy. Built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript tools like D3.js, Plotly, and Leaflet.js, the app is fast and user friendly.
